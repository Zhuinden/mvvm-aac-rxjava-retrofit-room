## [DEMO] MVVM, AAC (ViewModel), RxJava2, Retrofit, Room

Using:

- Jetpack ViewModel
- Jetpack LiveData
- Jetpack Room
- [LiveEvent](https://github.com/Zhuinden/live-event)
- [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/tree/2.x)
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)

No Dagger, because it was specifically requested not to have Dagger in it. So using the principles outlined in [Clean Android Code](https://spring.io/blog/2011/08/26/clean-code-in-android-applications) for DI principles.
